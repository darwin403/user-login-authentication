Frontend and Backend are independent aspects of the application. 

The frontend is built using [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/) ReactJS application.

The backend uses SQLite3 for database and ExpressJS framework. 

An experienced developer can quicky go through both the aspects of the application and understand all aspects of it rather easily.

In anycase, a quick over is given below

# Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Scripts

```
npm start # starts development server
npm build # compiled source files to ./build
```

# Backend

```bash
cd api
npm install
```

Development

```
nodemon app.js
```

Deploy server

```
node app.js
```
